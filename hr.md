####Expectations
                                    
In exchange for our benefits package, which includes a good salary, group health insurance, technology stipend, support for professional development, vacation and sick time policies, gym membership, great colleagues, superior work, excellent culture, and all the coffee you can drink, dojo4 asks you to keep in mind a few expectations that will make this relationship very successful:

The amount, value and quality of your work: 
If you’re a full-time employee, work on dojo4 activities for 40 hours or more (average) per week.
Produce excellent work product befitting a professional in your field.
Work mostly (>60% of your time) on projects that we can bill for.
Your integration with dojo4:
Participate in established processes; work to improve them if they need improvement.
Be available instantly when you are working (by smartphone, IM, and campfire). 
Bring a computer that is secure, up-to-date, functional, and installed with all the tools that you require to do your job.
Your demeanor:
Try to make everyone’s job easier and more fun. Take things off of your coworker’s plates. Smile.
Be generous with your help.
Treat everyone who encounters dojo4 with respect and kindness.
Your professional initiative:
Take responsibility for your own professional development -- seek opportunities to grow your skills and make better work product.
Help find potential clients for dojo4: Look for opportunities to talk about dojo4, invite people to discuss projects with us.
Take ownership of your work and deliver it to the satisfaction of its budgetary stakeholders.
Contribute to internal projects.
Make things and put them in the public domain. Talk about them.

The above expectations apply every day. But they will be especially valuable:
When we have an opportunity to give employee bonuses
When we have an opportunity to change someone’s compensation
When we have an opportunity to promote someone
If we ever need to change the composition of our team
Quarterly, when we review the state of dojo4
                                    
####Operational Details                                    
In keeping with the expectations we have of one another at dojo4, below are outlined some of the things that allow us to keep things running smoothly, empower each other to get good work done, have maximal fun, and not have to micromanage one another. Please learn and use these systems. You can bring any questions you might have to Corey.    

#####Tracking Time            

Tracking your time and Status messages
Please track your real time spent on dojo4 projects everyday. This includes client and internal projects. And please post your time from the previous day in your morning’s status message. Once a week a time tracking report will be sent out that will include everyone’s time tracked.


Status message time tracking format
Please use this format for reporting time tracked in your status messages:

2012-03-15

@project 1.5
description of activities

@project 2.5
description of activities

@project 4
description of activities

Rules of thumb for tracking your time:
record your time spent on each project at least daily, if not throughout the day
round up to the nearest quarter or half hour, whatever makes the most sense for you
please track the time you spend on internal projects, as well as client projects
log the real hours you spend; do not adjust your hours anticipating some outcome. Work with dojo4’s business team to handle any disconnect between hours and value.


    
#####Money                        
W4 forms
Full-time employees:  The Form W-4 is used by dojo4 to determine the correct amount of tax withholding to deduct from employees' wages. The form is not mailed to the IRS, but rather retained by dojo4.  Please download this form and return to Corey.

#####Direct Deposit                                
Please make sure to give Corey your banking information (name on the bank account, routing and account numbers). Your pay will be automatically deposited into your bank account, on the 1st and 15th of every month. If, during any week, you need an advance to the direct deposit, please let Corey know and most likely she’ll be able to write you a check.

#####Bonuses                                    
dojo4 is a scrappy young business, and its profitability is totally dependent on the quality and quantity of work we deliver every month. Annually, dojo4’s managers will review our financial performance; if possible, we will award bonuses. See Expectations, above.



####Communications & Operations

You will report directly to Corey Kohn, COO, but you can expect to field frequent requests from any of dojo4’s managers and partners, and from any of dojo4’s other employees. Each of us serves the others.                                
dojo4 email address
You will be given a dojo4 email address. Please use this address for internal and client correspondence.

#####dojo4 avatar and gravatar
As soon as we can, we’ll have someone create a dojo4 avatar for you. It’ll show up on the website, on the projects site, and anywhere else gravatars are linked to email addresses. Please sign up for gravatar with your dojo4 email address, and add this avatar. You can also create a new address in an existing account.

#####google calendar
Please open a google calendar subscription under your dojo4 email address and share this calendar with everyone else at dojo4. With shared calendars we are all able to see each other’s basic schedules and able to plan around each other in that way. Please use this google calendar to invite people to meetings and manage your dojo4 appointments and other times you may be unavailable.

#####dojo email lists
When you receive your dojo4 email address, you will be added to the nuclear@dojo4.com email list. Any email written to that address will be received by everyone else at dojo4. There are a few other lists, as well, that you will be added to on an as needed basis. 


#####status emails
Everyone at dojo4 also belongs to the status@dojo4.com email list. Please write to this address every morning with your status in the subject heading. This email will be received by each person at dojo4 and is meant to act as a status report / mini standup so that each person gets a general sense of what everyone else is doing that day and what the basic structure of their schedule is for the day. You’ll get a sense of the content and style by seeing other people’s status messages. It is important that everyone writes in a status message early-ish in the day: it allows us to avoid having to have unnecessary meetings, micromanagement, and allows us to help each other with one another’s work load. 

#####Redmine
Redmine is an open-source, flexible project management web application. Written using Ruby on Rails framework, it is cross-platform and cross-database. You will be given access to projects.
    
We use Redmine for:
    
project support
flexible issue tracking system
client communication

#####Campfire
dojo4 uses Campfire to communicate with each other throughout the day. You can get to the Campfire used the most at dojo4 by selecting the Chat tab in the Protected project. 

#####Github
If for some reason you are a programmer without a Github account, please get one now. As a designer, it’s well worth considering getting one, as well. Please use Github to commit code on a daily basis. 

Software development environment: Almost everyone at dojo4 touches code at some point. And people who touch code at dojo4 use a standardized coding environment. Individual environmental differences from the standard environment cannot be allowed to get in the way of work we do -- so you should either be really good at managing your environment on your own time, or, better yet, use the same environment as the rest of us. We use OSX, generally; Github for source code management; RVM for Rails version management; Homebrew for OSX package management; and more. We don’t care what text editor you use. Ask us for help getting set up when you join the team.

#####Dropbox
This system has yet to be perfected at dojo4. We keep lots of shared project files in a team Dropbox account, but have unfortunately yet to have made it consistent. The designers use it more effectively than anyone else, so if you are looking for particular assets, this is a good place to start.

#####daily standup
Daily standups happen every week day at noon. Everyone at the dojo stands up, generally in a circle, and gives a quick summary of what they are working on that day(s). Participants include both employees and contractors. It’s a chance for everyone to find out what everyone else is working on and where they may want/need to synch further. 

#####Friday standup                    
The dojo4 weekly standup happens promptly every Friday at 12:00pm and rarely takes more than 15-20 minutes. Our weekly standup is meant to allow us to gain a better understanding of the people we work with and what is important to them. We spend endless hours and emails relating the practical details of our work projects to each other, but it is rare that we get a chance to relate to each other in a genuine and candid way about what may (or may not) be meaningful to us. Granting a little time to cultivating that understanding with each other can feel incalculably more valuable to each other and the health of our business than any other way that we could spend 15 minutes ‘meeting’. There is also a chance at the end of the standup to make any general announcement (e.g. taking an upcoming vacation? or having a baby? this is a good time to let everyone know). 


Our weekly standups look something like this:
The standup starts with everyone doing a bow and a clap, and ends with the reverse (clap then bow). 
We start with a minute or two of quiet, allowing everyone to slow down a little and arrive.
A different person brings a question every week, that each person then has a chance to answer. Examples of some of the questions that have brought can be found in the dojo4 question bank. 
The guidelines for the standup are:
    * speak from the heart
    * listen completely
* don’t think about or decide what you are going to say while someone else is talking
    * say only what needs to be said
    * don’t withhold from saying something that needs to be said
    * it is not necessary to speak
    * don’t talk while someone else is talking
* each person goes only once
    * anything said during the standup is confidential
There’s a ‘talking piece’ in the middle that each person can pick up and hold if they are inspired to say something.
Who is going to bring the question the following week is decided at the end of each standup.
Announcements from anyone who has one.
We end with a clap and a bow.

#####org dev
Every Tuesday at 1pm everyone that works at dojo4 gathers for an hour of organizational development. The content of these meetings changes week to week, but the general intention is to participate in an engaged inquiry into what makes us more self-aware as a company and as individuals, so that we can create and iterate on systems that make dojo4 a compelling and effective environment to work. 

#####core hours
Since many of us have variable schedules and may like to work remotely at time, dojo4 has some loose ‘core hours’ to ensure that there are at least some times that we are all likely to be in the same place at the same time. These hours are Tues-Thurs 1-5pm. These ‘core hours’ are meant to support communications, project flow and esprits de corp. 

The same logic applies to this as to stand ups: it's good to be there, and if you really can't, don't sweat it. But please do try to bias yourself toward planning on being here during those hours. And try not to plan off-site meetings during those times unless you have to.

#####checking in
Many of dojo4’s contributors like having a regularly scheduled opportunity to check in and hear how they’re doing, hear whether there is anything they can do better, and offer their own feedback for dojo4’s managers. We want that, too! Please schedule these at a sane interval with the manager you want to talk with.

#####being a project lead
You may be asked if you’d like to take on the role of ‘project lead’ on a particular project. In most cases, this is completely optional. If you are interested in this type of position, please make yourself familiar with the responsibilities of the role. If you are project lead, please come to the weekly leads meeting on Tuesdays right after standup. dojo4 will generally take you out for lunch for this. 



####Non-Discrimination Policy

It is the policy and commitment of dojo4 that it does not discriminate on
the basis of race, age, color, sex, national origin, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation or religion.

#####Equal Employment Opportunity
dojo4 is committed to a policy of equal employment opportunity and does
not discriminate in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment on account of
race, age, color, sex, national origin, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation or religion or otherwise as may be prohibited by federal and state law.

Any employee, client or volunteer who believes that s/he or any other affiliate of dojo4 has been discriminated against is strongly encouraged to report this concern promptly to the COO.

#####Discriminatory Harassment
Harassment or intimidation of an employee, client or guest, because of that person’s
race, age, color, sex, national origin, physical or mental disability, sexual orientation or religion is specifically prohibited and may be grounds for termination. Harassment and intimidation includes abusive or threatening language or behavior. dojo4 is committed to maintaining a workplace that is free of any such harassment and will not tolerate discrimination against employees, clients, volunteers or guests. Issues of discriminatory treatment, harassment, or intimidation on any of these bases
should immediately be reported to the COO and, if substantiated, prompt action will be taken.


####Benefits
#####Health Insurance 

dojo4 offers its full-time employees and their dependants access to Rocky Mountain Small Group GH PPO 3000/100 Plan, starting on the 1st of the month following hire.  A full description of the health plan can be downloaded.  dojo4 will pay 100% of monthly premiums for full-time employees and 25% of monthly premiums for their dependants.  If you choose to use another plan, dojo4 will pay, monthly, whatever we would have paid for your premium but cannot pay a stipend for the 25% of monthly premiums we would pay on our plan for dependants. To apply for this coverage, Corey will put you in contact with Kate Paulin at Sabo financial at 303-938-2686. Dental is an option you may choose to add to your plan.

#####Paid Leave
dojo4’s employee benefits include two kinds of paid leave: flexible paid time off (PTO) and days when the office is closed and employees get the day off (paid, as well).

dojo4 is closed:
* New Year's Day (if on a weekday)
* 4th of July (if on a weekday)
* Memorial Day
* Labor Day
* Thanksgiving Day 
* Friday following Thanksgiving Day
* Dec. 25th - Dec. 31st

In rare cases, one of dojo4’s partners may ask you to work during a shop closure. Those days will be reimbursed with PTO. In all other cases, enjoy a day off.

In addition to shop closures, full-time dojo4 employees accrue 15 PTO days a year. You accrue them on the following schedule: Five days accrued Jan 1; five days accrued April 1; and five days accrued July 1.

PTO is intended to be used for any personal need -- for illness, for family, for vacation.

#####PTO Accrual
PTO is accrued as you work. You will not accrue PTO time while you are on an unpaid leave of absence or long-term disability.

Accrued PTO has no expiration -- you may carry it over from year to year. However, you may accrue a maximum of 15 days of PTO. Once you reach the maximum, you must use some accrued PTO in order to receive PTO at the next accrual. The intent of this policy is to encourage you to take time off for fun and recuperation.

Five days of PTO are accrued every quarter (as described, above) except for the last quarter of the year. New employees are given an initial prorated number of days according to when in the quarter they are hired, with fractions of days rounded up to the half-day. If an employee is hired between October 1st and the end of the 3rd week of December, no PTO days are accrued at hire, but the full winter holiday week that dojo4 is closed will be paid, regardless of the exact date of hire. 
Notice and Scheduling
PTO is a benefit of full time employment at dojo4, but its timing is subject to all manner of business context. There may be occasions, such as sudden illness, when you cannot give advance notice. In all other cases please request PTO (from Corey) and get approval for it. If your request for PTO creates substantial hardship for dojo4, please be prepared to adjust to accommodate the business.
PTO Management
dojo4 values a flexible workplace where you can choose when and where you put in your time. For errands and appointments and the occasional afternoon bike ride or long weekend, you have the option to simply make up the time in the same week, or to take PTO. You’re responsible for managing your time and meeting the expectations of your colleagues and clients. 

When you take time off:
If you intend to use some of your accrued PTO, please tell Corey. 
If you intend to make up the time you took off by working extra, please tell Corey and please follow through on that. 
In general, subject to all manner of context beyond the scope of this document, any full or partial day you do not work and do not make up will be considered PTO and will be deducted from your accrued PTO.
Unpaid TIme Off
In some cases (lengthy illness or extended break from work), you may need to take more time off than your accrued PTO allows. In such cases, please discuss your situation with Corey. Unpaid leave is a possibility, but it depends on many factors beyond the scope of this document. No unpaid leave will be granted until accrued PTO is exhausted.

#####Tracking Paid Time Off
A dojo4 manager will track accrued PTO for each employee. If you have any questions, just ask.
PTO at Termination
You will be paid for all accrued PTO remaining when you leave the company.

#####Parental Leave for the birth / adoption of a child
Parental leave after the birth of a child has been shown to cultivate significant benefits for the early development and health of a newborn. Supporting healthy families, and fostering equilibrium between home and work life, is integral to the success of dojo4, as a business and a culture. As such, dojo4 provides various benefits for paternity and maternity leave associated with the birth or adoption of a child by a dojo4 employee.

The time-off offered is outlined below, but in each case there may be differences depending on the nature of your particular job and circumstances. Inevitably various questions will arise according to your situation:
* will my specific job still be there when I return?
* how will dojo4 fill my shoes while I'm gone?
* what if I want to go to permanent part-time after my baby is born?
* if i go to unpaid time, is my job still guaranteed? for how long?

Since dojo4 is a small company, with each employee filling a unique role, the answers to these questions will vary according to each circumstance. Please talk to us (the partners) about what you need and want in terms of having a new addition to your family. dojo4 will do its best in each situation to help support a healthy and sustainable family / work balance.
Paternity Leave
To qualify for Paternity Leave you must be an employee, working at least 30 hours/week. You must be taking the time off to support the mother or carer for the baby and intend to be fully involved in the child's upbringing. Rights to Paternity Leave are extra to your normal PTO allowance.

dojo4 wants you to love your technology and have computers and phones that work. Each dojo4 employee is granted a $1500/year stipend to keep their hardware and software up to date. It will be paid monthly.

We have some basic standards for technology that we’d like your phone and computer to meet. Your computer needs to be stable, secure, loaded with legal copies of the software you use to do your job, and powerful enough to run that software. Your phone needs to be similar to the phones we build software for -- Android or iOS -- and it should ring if we call you. The technology stipend is intended to help cover the costs of keeping your tools sharp.
