## dojo4 parental leave for the birth / adoption of a child

Parental leave after the birth of a child has been shown to cultivate significant benefits for the early development and health of a newborn. Supporting healthy families, and fostering equilibrium between home and work life, is integral to the success of dojo4, as a business and a culture. As such, dojo4 provides various benefits for paternity and maternity leave associated with the birth or adoption of a child by a dojo4 employee.

The time-off offered is outlined below, but in each case there may be differences depending on the nature of your particular job and circumstances. Inevitably various questions will arise according to your situation:

* will my specific job still be there when I return?
* how will dojo4 fill my shoes while I'm gone?
* what if I want to go to permanent part-time after my baby is born?
* if I go to unpaid time, is my job still guaranteed? for how long?

Since dojo4 is a small company, with each employee filling a unique role, the answers to these questions will vary according to each circumstance. Please talk to us (the partners) about what you need and want in terms of having a new addition to your family. dojo4 will do its best in each situation to help support a healthy and sustainable family / work balance.
